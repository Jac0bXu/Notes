\section{Course Introduction}

This course covers fundamental concepts and applications 
for electrical and computer engineers as well as for engineers
 who need to gain a broad understanding of these disciplines. 
 The course starts by the basic concepts of charge, current, 
 and voltage as well as their expressions with regards to 
 resistors and resistive circuits. Essential concepts, 
 devices, theorems, and applications of direct-current (DC), 
 1st order, and alternating-current (AC) circuits are 
 subsequently discussed. Besides electrical devices and 
 circuits, basic electronic components including diodes and 
 transistors as well as their primary applications are also 
 discussed. For more information, see the syllabus. 

\section{Equations}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item P = $\frac{dW}{dt}$
    \item Coulomb's Law: $\vec{F} = \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0}\frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2}\hat{r}$
    \item Kirchhoff's Voltage Law: 
    \item Ohm's Law: $V=IR$

\end{enumerate}

\section{Charge, current, voltage, and power}

\defn{Charge}{A fundemental property of matter.}

\defn{Current}{The rate of flow of charge.}

\defn{Voltage}{Related to the potential energy of charges.}

\defn{Power}{The rate of doing work, or changing energy}

Passive sign convention is a sign convention or arbitrary 
standard rule adopted universally by the electrical 
engineering community for defining the sign of electric 
power in an electric circuit. The convention defines 
electric power flowing out of the circuit into an electrical 
component as positive, and power flowing into the circuit out 
of a component as negative. So a passive component which 
consumes power, such as an appliance or light bulb, will 
have positive power dissipation, while an active component, 
a source of power such as an electric generator or battery, 
will have negative power dissipation.

\section{(In)dependent sources, connections, resistance and Ohm's Law}

\defn{Series Combination}{In a series combination, the elements 
are connected with end to end in contact, such that 
current flow is equal in all the elements in the 
combination}

\defn{Parallel Combination}{When two or more resistances are 
connected between the same two points, they are said to be 
connected in parallel combination. In this case voltage is equal
across all elements}

Turning off a voltage source is equivalent to replacing it with a 
short circuit (line). 

Turning off a current source is equivalent to replacing it with an
open circuit (broken line).
