    \item $P = \frac{dW}{dt} = IV$
    \item $I = \frac{dq}{dt}$
    \item $V = \frac{W}{q}$
    \item $R = \frac{\rho L}{A}$
    \item Ohm's Law: $V=IR$
    \item Coulomb's Law: $\vec{F} = \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0}\frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2}\hat{r}$
    \item Kirchhoff's Voltage Law: $\sum V_i = 0$
    \item Conductance: $G = \frac{1}{R}$
    \item Equivalent resistance: $R_{eq} = \frac{V_{test}}{I_{test}}$
\end{enumerate}
\begin{itemize}
    \item[($R_{eq}$)] Turn off all independent sources (dependent
    sources remain unchanged) and calculate the resulting resistance at the
    desired port. Notice that you may have to apply the i-v test if resistors
    cannot be combined through series and parallel connections, or if the
    circuit includes dependent sources.
    \item[($V_{th}$)] Leave the desired port open-circuited
    (i.e. no load connected) and find the voltage across it.
    \item[($I_N$)] Short-circuit the desired port (i.e. connect
    a short circuit across the port) and find the current through it. 
\end{itemize}
