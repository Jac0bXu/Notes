\section{Introduction}

Digital design entails creating hardware that can conduct an operation or set
of operations within a computer system. For example, adding two numbers. \\
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width= 100px]{images/Screenshot 2024-01-08 151414.png}
\end{center}
This hardware can add two numbers, that is, conduct the operation $c=a+b$. It could also perform $f=d+e$ or $i=g-h=g+(-h)$ as it is not restricted to the sole values of $a$ and $b$ as inputs. This process fits into the logic design and switching algebra portions of chip manufacturing.\\
The creation of systems like these is based on the fact that voltage and current are time-varying and can assume any value in a continuous range of real numbers, but are mapped to only two values.

\subsection{Digital Logic Signals}
A digital signal is modeled assuming that at anytime, it can have only one of
two discrete values, which represent:\\
\begin{table}
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{c|c}
        0     & 1    \\
        LOW   & HIGH \\
        FALSE & TRUE \\
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}
This is called positive logic.
It maps the infinite values of voltage and current to these two values.
An example of this is CMOS 2-Volt logic:\\
\begin{table}
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{c|c}
        0      & 1        \\
        \hline
        0-0.5V & 1.5-2.0V \\
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}
These completely separated ranges of values allow for 0 and 1 to be completely separate, with noise and other possible errors being ignored. In this way, all physical values can be partitioned into the two values, though, for intents and purposes of digital system design, voltage is the most relevant.\\
Additionally, circuits known as buffer circuits can be used to restore logic values. That is, if a voltage is not sufficiently close to the values of 0 or 2 (in the case of the CMOS), they can push these values far closer to the desired values, reducing the possibility of error.\\
Digital circuits have replaced analog circuits becuse they are far easier to design. They can be made using Hardware Description Languages (HDLs), softwares that are similar to programming languages.\\
A logic value is called a binary digit, or bit. A set of $n$ bits, represent $2^n$ values. For example:
\begin{table}
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{c}
        $b_0$ \\
        \hline
        0     \\
        1     \\
    \end{tabular}
    \quad
    \begin{tabular}{c c}
        $b_0$ & $b_1$ \\
        \hline
        0     & 0     \\
        1     & 0     \\
        0     & 1     \\
        1     & 1
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}
\subsection{Logic Circuits}
At the highest level, a logic circuit is a \textit{black box} with $n$ inputs
and $m$ outputs. Only zeros and ones are required to represent inputs and
outputs. \\ Combinational circuits are circuits that have outputs that solely
depend on the inputs. It can be represented by a truth table.\\ An adder can be
represented by a truth table in this manner.
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width= 100px]{images/Screenshot 2024-01-10 144557.png}
\end{center}
On the other hand, a sequential circuit has memory. That is, the output is dependent on both the inputs and the current state of the circuit itself. This is representable through a state table.\\
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width= 150px]{images/state table.png}
\end{center}
\subsection{Gates}
Basic digital devices are called gates. These implement basic logic functions.
These are AND, OR, NOT. However, AND, NOT and OR, NOT are sufficient to make
any combination, as the third gate can be formed as a combination of the other
two.\\ Each of the gates is represented symbolically like the following, and
have their truth tables shown below:\\
\begin{table}
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{c|c|c}
        AND                                                & OR                                                & NOT                                                \\
        \hline
        \includegraphics[width= 80px]{images/AND_GATE.png} & \includegraphics[width= 80px]{images/OR_GATE.png} & \includegraphics[width= 80px]{images/INVERTER.png} \\
        \hline
        \begin{tabular}{c c|c}
            x & y & {$x\land y$} \\
            \hline
            0 & 0 & 0            \\
            0 & 1 & 0            \\
            1 & 0 & 0            \\
            1 & 1 & 1
        \end{tabular}                            &
        \begin{tabular}{c c|c}
            x & y & {$x\lor y$} \\
            \hline
            0 & 0 & 0           \\
            0 & 1 & 1           \\
            1 & 0 & 1           \\
            1 & 1 & 1
        \end{tabular}                             &
        \begin{tabular}{c|c}
            x & {$\lnot x$} \\
            \hline
            0 & 1           \\
            1 & 0           \\
        \end{tabular}
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}
This can be done for more inputs, by combining multiple gates.\\ There are two more often used gates that can be created through a combination of these two.\\
\begin{table}
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{c|c}
        NAND                                                & NOR                                                \\
        \hline
        \includegraphics[width= 80px]{images/NAND_GATE.png} & \includegraphics[width= 80px]{images/NOR_GATE.png} \\
        \hline
        \begin{tabular}{c c|c}
            x & y & {$\lnot(x\land y)$} \\
            \hline
            0 & 0 & 1                   \\
            0 & 1 & 1                   \\
            1 & 0 & 1                   \\
            1 & 1 & 0
        \end{tabular}                &
        \begin{tabular}{c c|c}
            x & y & {$\lnot(x\lor y)$} \\
            \hline
            0 & 0 & 1                  \\
            0 & 1 & 0                  \\
            1 & 0 & 0                  \\
            1 & 1 & 0
        \end{tabular}
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}
It is a good exercise to see how two of the basic gates (AND, NOT or OR, NOT) can be used to create the rest, as it is possible to connect gates to form complex circuits and thus, complex functions.\\
\textit{Note: By convention, signal flows from left to right. Thus, output comes out the right and input goes in at left.}
\subsection{Timing}
When the values of an input changes, it takes time for the outputs to change as
well, which is known as \textit{propagation delay}, which can be represented in
a timing diagram. However, for most cases, it is possible ot ignore these, as
the behavior is well defined regardless of delay.\\ The following is a timing
diagram:\\
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width= 200px]{images/timing_table.png}
\end{center}
Propagation delay, represented by pd in the timing diagram, is irrelevant if there are no changes, regardless of the fact that there is a new set of inputs. The values at the bottom of the diagram are the values that each of the elements hold after all the necessary transitions have happened for that set of inputs.\\
Transition time is the time it takes for a signal to change from 0 to 1, and is represented by "rt".
\subsection{Software Aspects of Digital Design}
Software is not technically essential to digital system design. People used to
draw symbold by hand, and could make technically equivalent systems. However,
the availability, utility, and ease of use of HDLs has made the use of software
prevalent in the current technological landscape.\\ Electronic Design
Automation tools are useful in improving designer productivity. The following
are examples of these:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Schematic entry: Allows for fully detailed digital diagrams to be created
          digitally.
    \item HDLs: Can be used to design anythong from individual function modules to
          multichip digital systems. This course will involve extensive use of VHDL.
    \item HDL text editors, compilers, synthesizers: text editor to define, compiler to
          debug syntax, synthesizer to create corresponding circuit or chip.
    \item Simulator: It is virtually impossible to debug a synthesized chip, so
          simulators are used before synthesis. They allow for verification of
          functionality prior to the actual tedious process of synthesis. Among
          simulators, there are also PCB simulators, and FPGAs, which are like
          programmable chips. They are very important.
    \item Test benches: Designs are simulated and tested using these. They run a series
          of checks to ensure that nothing stopped working due to changes.
    \item Timing analyzers and verifiers: Correct timing of inputs and reactiosn are
          paramount in digital systems. This facet of simulation allows for the
          automation of timing functionality verification.
    \item Word Processors: Allow for pretty documentation to be created.
\end{itemize}
Software is important, but the understanding of what it actually does is even more so.
\subsection{Integrated Circuits}
A collection of gates on a single silicon chip is called an integrated circuit
or IC.\\ An IC originates from a wafer, which is segmented into many identical
ICs. The wafer is divided into rectangles, called \textit{dies} which in turn
have \textit{pads} which allow for wire connections. Microscopic probes are
used to debug the wafers, and defects are discarded, and the succeses, cut
out.\\ For this class, an IC, is a packaged die.\\ ICs were divided by size,
small SSIs with 1 to 20 gates, medium MSIs with 20 to 200, large LSIs with upto
1000, and vely large VLSIs fro everything above that. The largest VLSIs now
have over 10 billion transistors.\\ An IC process is the steps taken to create
an IC, and are categorized by the transistor density within the chip.
\subsection{Logic Families}
There are many different ways of implementing logic circuits. Connectable logic
circuits are of the same logic family. So, the technology controlling them is
different. Chips need to be from the same family to be connected to each other.
If they are from different families, they cannot be connected to each other.\\
For example TTL (Transistor-Transistor Logic) is a logic family based on
bipolar junction transistors.\\ CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor)
is based on MOSFETs (MOS Field-Effect Transistors). These are more commonly
used, and the ones we will be analyzing in this class.\\
\subsection{CMOS Logic Circuits}
A MOS transistor is modellable as a voltage controlled resistor. This means
that the input voltage controls the resistance of the MOSFET, allowing it to
act as a kind of switch. This is because it has only two effective states: very
high resistance and very low resistance.\\ This is an n-channel (NMOS)
transistor:
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width= 100px]{images/nmos.png}
\end{center}
When $V_{gs} = 0$, the resistance is very high.\\
When $V_{gs}$ is increased, the resistance is very low.\\
On the other hand, this is the PMOS transistor:\\
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width= 100px]{images/pmos.png}
\end{center}
When $V_{sg} = 0$, the resistance is very high.\\
When $V_{sg}$ is increased, the resistance is very low.\\
NMOS and PMOS together allow us to form CMOS logic.
For example, this is a CMOS inverter, in which the output will be the opposite of the input.\\
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width= 100px]{images/cmosinverter.png}
\end{center}
If $V_{in} = 3.3V$, or high, the PMOS transistor be off, and the NMOS would be on. This would mean that the output and ground are shorted, causing the output to be low.\\
If $V_{in} = 0V$, or low, the PMOS transistor be on, and the NMOS would be off. This would mean that the output and $V_{DD}$ are shorted, causing the output to be high.\\
This allows this to be act as an inverter.\\
Now we will observe the CMOS arrangement of a NAND gate.
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width= 150px]{images/cmosnand.png}
\end{center}
If A and B are both HIGH, both PMOS are HIGH, and thus $V_{DD}$ is shorted to Z.\\
If they are both LOW, the exact opposite happens, with Z shorting to ground.\\
If A or B are HIGH, than one of the PMOS will be high, and one of the NMOS will be LOW, causing the output to be HIGH.\\
The NOR gate can be constructed easily from the same thought process, but NMOS in parallel, and PMOS in series.\\
These can be expanded to more inputs by adding more transistors.\\
\subsection{Preview of future topics}
%Fan-in is the number of inputs that a gate has. As it increases, the resistances of the transistors increase, and thus, the delay.
The following is a multiplexer:
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width= 100px]{images/multiplexer.png}
\end{center}
It outputs A when S is 0, and B when S is 1. It allows us to select between different functions, such as adding and subtracting.\\
Truth tables are another form of representation of a digital system. We will later learn how to analyze and derive equations from truth tables, as well as the gate implementation.\\
\textit{Note: CMOS logic doesn't have AND, OR gates, so the actual implementation of these two is NAND, NOR gates with an inverter.}\\
Gates require 4 transistors, and inverters need two transistors.
Verilog Structural model:
\begin{lstlisting}
    module Ch1mux_s(A,B,S,Z);
        input A,B,S;
        output Z;
        wire SN,ASN,SB;
        not U1(SN,S);
        and U2(ASN,A,SN);
        and U3(SB,B,S);
        or U4(Z,ASN,SB);
    endmodule
\end{lstlisting}
Which is equivalent to:
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width= 150px]{images/verilog_implementation.png}
\end{center}
\textit{Note: the order of these statements is irrelevant, they will result in the same digital system.}
Verilog Behavioral Model:
\begin{lstlisting}
    module Ch1mux_b(A,B,S,Z);
        input A,B,S; \\input declaration
        output reg Z; \\output declaration
        always @(A,B,S) \\if input changes, recompute
        if (S==1) Z=B; 
        else Z=A; \\this is saying what the multiplexer above did
    endmodule
\end{lstlisting}
\section{Number Systems and Codes}
A digital circuit processes binary digits in the form of bits.\\ It is
impoortant to see how these relate to real life values.\\ Numbers in the
decimal system:
\begin{equation*}
    abcd = 1000a+100b+10c+d = 10^3a+10^2b+10^1c+10^0d
\end{equation*}
The base, or radix is 10.
For a general radix $r$, it would be:
\begin{equation*}
    abcd = r^3a+r^2b+r^1c+r^0d
\end{equation*}
For this course, we care about binary, or radix 2.\\
Occasionally, base 8 (octal) and base 16 (hexadecimal) are also relevant.
\begin{table}
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{c|c|c}
        base 2 & base 8 & base 16 \\
        \hline
        0      & 0      & 0       \\
        1      & 1      & 1       \\
        10     & 2      & 2       \\
        11     & 3      & 3       \\
        100    & 4      & 4       \\
        101    & 5      & 5       \\
        110    & 6      & 6       \\
        111    & 7      & 7       \\
        1000   & 10     & 8       \\
        1001   & 11     & 9       \\
        1010   & 12     & A       \\
        1011   & 13     & B       \\
        1100   & 14     & C       \\
        1101   & 15     & D       \\
        1110   & 16     & E       \\
        1111   & 17     & F       \\
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}
To convert from octal to binary, replace every octal with three bits starting from the least significant bit.  For hexadecimal, replace each digit with 4 bits.\\
The least significant bit(LSB) is the last bit, and the first is the most significant bit (MSB).\\
To convert from decimal to binary by dividing the number by 2, and assigning the remainder to the least siginificant unassigned bit. Do this continuously to the quotient until done.\\
\subsection{Adding and Subtracting}
To add and subtract in binary:\\
\begin{table}
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{c c c c c c}
          & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & + \\
          & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 &   \\
        \hline
        1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1
    \end{tabular}
    \quad\quad
    \begin{tabular}{c c c c c c}
        1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & - \\
          & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 &   \\
        \hline
        1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 &
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}
To add signs to numbers, it has been standardized that the first bit defines the sign. If the leftmost bit is 0, the number is posititve. and if it is 1, the number is negative. \\This allows an n-bit signed integer to be from the range $-2^{n-1}+1 \text{ to } 2^{n-1}-1.$\\
To actually add and subtract numbers, we first check if the sign is the same, if it is, we add directly, and append the sign bit. If they have opposing signs, we find the larger number, subtract the smaller, and use the sign of the larger.\\
\subsection{Using the complement to conduct operations}
In the complement number system, we can add or subtract directly, the
operations can be done directly. The complementation process is more
complicated than sign checking, but it simplifies addition.\\ The 2-complement
system is the difference between $2^n$ and the n-bit integer. To compute $-B$,
we first need to calculate $2^n-B$, which we can compute as $(2^n-1)-B+1$,
which is essentially inverting each bit, and adding 1 to the result. (Carries
outside the bit length are ignored.)\\ The most significant bit of the
complement acts as a sign bit. This can be seen in the following table:
\begin{table}
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{c c|c c}
        number & binary & negative & binary \\
        \hline
        0      & 0000   & -0       & 0000   \\
        1      & 0001   & -1       & 1111   \\
        2      & 0010   & -2       & 1110   \\
        3      & 0011   & -3       & 1101   \\
        4      & 0100   & -4       & 1100   \\
        5      & 0101   & -5       & 1011   \\
        6      & 0110   & -6       & 1010   \\
        7      & 0111   & -7       & 1001   \\
        -      & -      & -8       & 1000   \\

    \end{tabular}
\end{table}
The magnitude of a number can be computed as for an unsigned number, except that the weight of the MSB is $-2^{n-1}$ instead of $2^{n-1}$. So, to subtract $2^n$, replace the weight of the MSB with $-2^{n-1}$.\\
To add a bit to a complement number, we can simply duplicate the MSB at the beginning of the MSB.
As proof of this actually working, we can calculate the complement of both the complement and the modified complement as uncomplemented numbers, and we can observe that they will be the same.\\
That is, the complement of 11001 and 111001 is the same number, the same happens for 011 and 0011.\\
We can also reverse this process if the digits corresponding to the removed bits of the given complement are all the same.\\
Now we will analyze how the complement can be used to add and subtract.\\

\end{center}
This process may not work if overflow occurs. That is, if the number of necessary bits to represent the result of an operation are more than the available bits. This can only occur if the numbers being operated on have the same sign.\\
To subtract two numbers, we instead use the following property: $X-Y = X+(-Y) = X+Y'+1$ where $Y'$ is the complement of $Y$.

\subsection{Binary Codes for Decimal Numbers}
A set of \textit{n}-bit strings in which differnt bit strings represent
diffferent elements of a set is called a code. A combination on these is a code
word.\\ 0 through 9 requires at least 4 bits, but there are many methods of
doing so.\\
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width = \textwidth]{images/decimal_codes.png}
\end{center}
Another very important representation is the gray code.\\
By partitioning a disk into eight regions, with n bits with sensors in each, any number between 0 and $2^n -1$ can be represented.\\
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width = 200px]{images/gray_code.png}
\end{center}
\textit{Note: if the disk stops between two sections, there is a possibility of error. Using standard binary representation will cause the error to be very large, as it can stop between 000 and 111, which would imply that any of the bits can have error, and thus any of the numbers between 0 and 7 can be represented.}
This is where the gray code comes in:\\
\begin{table}
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{c|c}
        number & gray code \\
        \hline
        0      & 000       \\
        1      & 001       \\
        2      & 011       \\
        3      & 010       \\
        4      & 110       \\
        5      & 111       \\
        6      & 101       \\
        7      & 100       \\
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}
This encoding allows there to be only one bit of change between any two consecutive digits, allowing us to reduce the margin of error.\\
Codes can also be used to represent text, as the ASCII does, which uses a 7-bit code word.\\
The selection of code and code words is very important, as it can drastically change the complexity of the designed circuit:

\section{Switching Algebra and Combinational Logic}
A combinational circuit depends only on the inputs. We will begin by
considering single ouptut combinational circuits.\\ Switching algebra is a
mathematical tool used for circuit design. It is a subset of boolean algebra. A
variable is used to represent a signal.\\
\subsection{Axioms}
\begin{itemize}
    \item (A1) $X=0$ if $X \neq 1$
    \item (A1D) $X=1$ if $X \neq 0$
\end{itemize}
There is a principle of duality in this axiom, as do most properties of switching algebra.\\
\begin{itemize}
    \item (A2) $X=0 \implies X' = 1$
    \item (A2D) $X=1 \implies X'=0$
    \item (A3) $0 \land 0 = 0$
    \item (A4) $1 \land 1 = 1$
    \item (A5) $0\land 1 = 1\land 0 = 0$
    \item (A6) $ 1 \lor 1=1$
    \item (A7) $0\lor 0 = 0$
    \item (A8) $1\lor 0 = 0\lor 1 = 1$
\end{itemize}
AND has a higher precedence than OR in logical expressions"
\begin{equation*}
    W\land Y \lor Y\land Z = (W\land X) \lor (Y\land Z)
\end{equation*}
\subsection{Theorems}
There are 5 theorems that can be easily be proven through this:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $X\lor 0=X$
    \item $X \lor 1 = 1$
    \item $X \lor X = X$
    \item $(X')'=X$
    \item $X\lor X' = 1$
\end{enumerate}
Which have the following dualities:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $X\land 1 =X$
    \item $X\land 0 = 0$
    \item $X \land X = X$
    \item No duality
    \item $X\land X' = 0$
\end{enumerate}
There are also two variable theorems:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Commutativity:
          \begin{enumerate}
              \item $X\lor Y=Y\lor X$
              \item $X\land Y = Y\land X$
          \end{enumerate}
    \item Associativity: \begin{enumerate}
              \item $(X\lor Y)\lor Z=X\lor (Y\lor Z)$
              \item $(X\land Y)\land Z=X\land (Y\land Z)$
          \end{enumerate}
          This allows for the representation of three or more input gates with ease.
    \item Distributivity:
          \begin{enumerate}
              \item $X\land Y \lor X\land Z = X\land(Y \lor Z)$
              \item $(X\lor Y)\land (X\lor Z) = X\lor Y\land Z$
          \end{enumerate}
    \item Covering:
          \begin{enumerate}
              \item $X\lor X\land Y = X$
              \item $X\land(X\lor Y) = X$
          \end{enumerate}
    \item Combining:
          \begin{enumerate}
              \item $X\land Y \lor X\land Y' = X$
              \item $(X\lor Y)\land (X\lor Y')=X$
          \end{enumerate}
    \item Consensus:
          \begin{enumerate}
              \item $X \land Y \lor X' \land Z \lor Y \land Z = X \land Y \lor X' \land Z$
              \item $(X \lor Y ) \land (X' \lor Z ) \land (Y \lor Z ) = (X \lor Y ) \land (X' \lor Z)$
          \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
All these theorems can be proven using perfect induction, that is, through building the complete truth table for the inputs, and showing that the output is always true.\\
Some of these can also be proven using the axioms and priorly proven theorems.
\textit{Note: The proof of one theorem, can be applied to the dual, but using the duals of the theorems used in the proof of the first.}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Variable Theorems:
          \begin{enumerate}
              \item $X\lor X\lor X \ldots \lor X = X$
              \item $X\land X\land X \ldots \land X = X$
          \end{enumerate}
    \item De Morgan's Theorems:
          \begin{enumerate}
              \item $(X_1\land X_2\land X_3 \ldots \land X_n)'=X_1'\lor X_2'\lor X_3' \ldots \lor X_n'$
              \item $(X_1\lor X_2\lor X_3 \ldots \lor X_n)'=X_1'\land X_2'\land X_3' \ldots \land X_n'$
          \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
Using De Morgan's Theorems allows us to change combinations of NANDs and NORs into more efficient NAND only or NOR only gate functions.\\
\textbf{De Morgan's Theorem Generalization:}
\begin{equation*}
    [F(X_1, X_2, . . . , X_n, \lor, \land)]'= [F(X_1', X_2', . . . , X_n', \land, \lor)]
\end{equation*}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Shannon's Expansion theorems:
          \begin{enumerate}
              \item $F(X_1, X_2, . . . , X_n) =X_1 \land F(1, X_2, . . . , X_n) \lor X_1' \land F(0, X_2, . . . , X_n)$
              \item $F(X_1, X_2, . . . , X_n) =X_1 \lor F(1, X_2, . . . , X_n) \land X_1' \lor F(0, X_2, . . . , X_n)$
          \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
These can be proven through finite induction.
\subsection{Connecting Switching Algebra and Combinational Logic}
We will start by defining some things:\\
\begin{itemize}
    \item A \textit{literal} is a variable that can be complemented or uncomplemented,
          for example $X,X',Y,Y'$
    \item A \textit{product term} is a literal or a product (AND) of two or more
          literals, for example $X,X',X\land Y'\land Z$
    \item A \textit{sum-of-products} is a sum (OR) of multiple products.
    \item A \textit{sum term} is a single literal or the sum (OR) of multiple literals.
    \item A \textit{product-of-sums} is a product of multiple sum terms.
    \item A \textit{normal term} is a product or sum in which no variable appears more
          than once.
    \item An \textit{n-variable minterm} is a normal product term with n literals. There
          are $2^n$ such terms. That is, each variable appears exactly once in the term,
          in either complemented or uncomplemented form. It is 1 in only one row of the
          truth table.
    \item An \textit{n-variable maxterm} is a normal sum term with n literals. Once
          again, there are $2^n$ such terms. It is 0 in only one row of the truth table.
    \item A \textit{canonical sum} of a function is the sum of the minterms corresponding
          to the rows where the truth-table of the function is 1.
          \begin{center}
              \includegraphics[width = 150px]{images/minterm_maxterm_func.png}
          \end{center}
          This has another notation, in which each row that is true is added to the sum:
          \begin{equation*}
              F = (1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1)=\sum_{X,Y,X}(0,3,4,5,7)
          \end{equation*}
    \item A \textit{canonical product} of a function is the product of the maxterms
          corresponding to the truth table rows where the function is 0.
          \begin{center}
              \includegraphics[width = 150px]{images/minterm_maxterm_func.png}
          \end{center}
          This also has another notation:
          \begin{equation*}
              F = (1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1)=\prod_{X,Y,X}(1,2,6)
          \end{equation*}
          \begin{center}
              \textit{Note: the union of the terms of the canonical product and the canonical sum, is the full truth table, or the numbers from $0\rightarrow 2^n-1$}
          \end{center}
\end{itemize}
A function can be written in Verilog by doing the following:
\begin{lstlisting}
    case{(X,Y,Z)}
        0,3,4,5,7:F=1;
        default:F=0;
    endcase
\end{lstlisting}
Or it can be written like this:
\begin{lstlisting}
    case{(X,Y,Z)}
        1,2,6:F=;
        default:F=1;
    endcase
\end{lstlisting}
Now that we have all the necessary definitions, we will go back to Shannon's
Expansion Theorem.
\begin{equation*}
    F(X_1, X_2, . . . , X_n) =X_1 \land F(1, X_2, . . . , X_n) \lor X_1' \land F(0, X_2, . . . , X_n)
\end{equation*}
This theorem allows us to extract a variable from a function and divide it into two halves, in which the term is true or false, while the remains have a smaller minterm, maxterm truth table.\\
\subsection{Combinational Circuit Analysis}
Circuit analysis is defined as locating the logic function that defines it. It
is the transition from a logic diagram to a truth table or an algebraic
expression.\\ Once this function is available, it can be used to determine the
behavior, or manipulate the circuit for more efficiency, or for different
elements. For example, it may be necessary to modify a circuit to transition
from PLA to FPGA.\\ To do so, all functions to be compared are reduced to the
canonical form, as it is unique.\\ One method of running analysis on a logic
circuit, we can analyze its output for each of the $2^n$ inputs it can get, and
find the output. However, this is no longer viable for large values of $n$.\\
The other method would be to find the output of each gate, starting from the
left towards the right of the circuit, each output is joined to find the end
function of the circuit. The function can then be minimized and made more
efficient.\\ DeMorgan's theorem can be used to simplify circuits, for example,
it can allow us to replace a NAND gate with an OR gate with inverted inputs, or
NOR gates with AND with inverted inputs. This is usually done from right to
left, replacing gates that we believe would allow us to simplify the circuit.
In most cases, the goal would be to reduce the number of inverters within the
circuit, as they may complicate the analysis once we have the function.\\
\subsection{Combinational Synthesis}
This is the process that goes form a truth table or function, and want to get
the circuit that defines it.\\ The goal is to make a circuit as small as
possible. This can be done through analyzing how many gates and gate inputs
there are.\\ We also want to minimize delay (gate levels) and power
dissipation.\\ In a design process, the software synthesizes a circuit.
However, knowledge is required to make sure the synthesized circuit is
efficient, or whether it can be improved.\\ The process starts from a
specification, in words, and leads to a function. However, in this class, we
will usually start from the function or truth table.\\ We want a minimal
sum-of-products or product-of-sums. After which, the next goal would be to
minimize the delay.\\ Canonical forms are usually larger than what we want.\\ If we want to find the canonical form, we conjoin each term of the function with the term that does not appear in both the original and negated form. For example, if we have X,Y,Z as inputs:
\begin{equation*}
    X\lor Y = X\lor Y \lor(Z\land Z')
\end{equation*}
This is done for each term, and then expanded, which will result in the canonical form.\\
However, it is more complicated to go from the canonical form to the original expression.\\
