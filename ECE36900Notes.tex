\section{Course Introduction}

This course introduces discrete mathematical structures and 
finite-state machines. Students will learn how to use logical 
and mathematical formalisms to formulate and solve problems in 
computer engineering. Topics include formal logic, proof techniques, 
recurrence relations, sets, combinatorics, relations, functions, 
algebraic structures, and finite-state machines. For more information,
see the syllabus. 

\section{Equations}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item De Morgan's Theorem: 
    
    $\neg(P \wedge Q) \equiv \neg P \vee \neg Q$

    $\neg(P \vee Q) \equiv \neg P \wedge \neg Q$

    \item Modus ponens (mp)
    
    $p$

    $p \rightarrow q$

    $\therefore q$

    \item Modus tonens (mt)
    
    $p \rightarrow q$

    $\neg q$

    $\therefore \neg p$
\end{enumerate}

\section{Propositional Logic}

We often wish that others would be more logical, tell the truth,
or shower. While studying formal logic cannot help with the latter
(in fact, studies have shown a negative correlation between
hygiene and studying formal logic) it is a useful way to 
define what the first mean two. In a formal logic model, we have two constructs:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \defn{Statements/propostion}{A statement or a proposition is a sentence that
    is either true or false.} Propositions are often represented 
    with letters of the alphabet. For example: "$q$: the more time
    you spend coding, the less time you have to buy deodorant."
    \item \defn{Logical connectives}{Used to connect statements.} For 
    example, "and" is a logical connective in English. It can be
    used to connect two statements, e.g. "the person next to me
    smells like dog \emph{and} looks like a dog" to obtain 
    a new statement with its own truth value. 
\end{itemize}

Here are common logical connectives in Boolean logic:
\begin{table}[h]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{lc}
    \toprule
    \textbf{Logical Connective} & \textbf{Symbol} \\
    \midrule
    Negation (NOT) & $\lnot$ or $'$ \\
    Conjunction (AND) & $\land$ \\
    Disjunction (OR) & $\lor$ \\
    Exclusive OR (XOR) & $\oplus$ \\
    Implication & $\rightarrow$ \\
    Biconditional & $\leftrightarrow$ \\
    \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Logical Connectives in Boolean Logic}
    \label{tab:logical-connectives}
\end{table}

\defn{Truth table}{Defines how each of the
connectives operate on truth values. Every connective has one.}
For example, consider $\land$ AND:

\begin{table}[ht]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|c c|c|}
    \hline
    $p$ & $q$ & $p \land q$ \\
    \hline
    T & T & T \\
    T & F & F \\
    F & T & F \\
    F & F & F \\
    \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Truth table for $\land$}
    \label{tab:truthtableand}
\end{table}
We see that $p$ AND $q$ is only true when $p$ is true and 
$q$ is true. Similarly, $p$ or $q$ is only true when $p$ is true or 
$q$ is true (or both). An important connective for 
discovering new truths is the implication $\rightarrow$, which basically
says "if the first letter is true, then so is the second".
Let $p$: "I live in Wiley" and $q$: "I have no AC". In English,
the statement $p \rightarrow q$ would be stated as "If I live in 
Wiley, then I have no AC". 

\begin{table}[ht]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|c c|c|}
    \hline
    $p$ & $q$ & $p \rightarrow q$ \\
    \hline
    T & T & T \\
    T & F & F \\
    F & T & T \\
    F & F & T\\
    \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Truth table for $\rightarrow$}
    \label{tab:truthtableimp}
\end{table}
Table \ref{tab:truthtableimp} shows the truth table for $\rightarrow$.
It may not seem immediately clear why, for instance, 
if $p$ and $q$ are false, then $p \rightarrow q$ is true.
If we consider what this means in English, then all we know is 
that I don't live in Wiley. Perhaps I live in Tarkington and still
don't have AC, or perhaps I live in Honors and I do. In any case
the first letter isn't true, so "if the first letter is true
then so is the second" stands as true. If we have the statement 
$p \rightarrow q$, then we call $q$ a \emph{necessary condition}
for $p$. Conversely, $p$ is a \emph{sufficient condition} for $q$.

Say we have a statement such as 
$\neg A \lor B \rightarrow C$.
This is ambiguous, since we can interpret 
it as either $(A \lor B) \rightarrow C$ 
or $A \lor (B \rightarrow C)$. The truth tables
will differ in each case, so it 
becomes necessary to specify in
what order we should apply logical
connectives. 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Parentheses "()"
    \item Negation "$\neg$"
    \item AND and OR "$\land$, $\lor$"
    \item Implication "$\rightarrow$"
    \item Biconditional "$\biconditional$"
\end{enumerate}

\section{Rules and proofs}

With each additional variable in your truth table, the number
of choices grows exponentially. Specifically, if you have $n$ statement
letters, you would have $2^n$ choices for your truth table. 

\defn{Tautology}{A formula that is true in every model.} 
Example: the Bible is infallible because the Bible itself
says it is infallible.  

\defn{Contradiction}{A formula that is false in every model} Examples:
"it is raining and it is not raining", "I am sleeping and I am awake", 
"IU is a good school". 

\marginnote{Interestingly, it is possible to prove any statement
in a system where a contradiction exists. This is known as the 
\emph{principle of explosion}. To see how it works, consider
the following example: 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item $p$: Donuts are good for you.
    \item $q$: Unicorns exist. 
\end{enumerate}

I'll now assume the contradictory statement "donuts are good for you
and donuts are not good for you".

\begin{align*}
    \neg p &\land p \quad \text{(Contradiction)} \\
    p &\lor q \quad \text{(Addition)}\\
    \neg p\\
    \therefore q
\end{align*}

Ergo, unicorns exist :)

}

Confusion often arises when negating a sentence such as 
"the book is thick and boring". An natural inclination is to 
negate it thus: "the book is not thick and not boring".
However, consider the truth table for this:
$p$: "the book is thick", $q$: "the book is boring". 
\begin{table}[ht]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|c c|c|c|c|}
    \hline
    $p$ & $q$ & $p \wedge q$ & $\neg(p \wedge q)$ & $\neg p \wedge \neg q$\\
    \hline
    T & T & T & F & F\\
    T & F & F & T & F\\
    F & T & F & T & F\\
    F & F & F & T & T\\
    \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \label{tab:demorganswrong}
\end{table}
We can see the last two rows are not identical, therefore
the negation of "the book is not thick and not boring"
is not "the book is not thick and not boring". For $p$ to 
be false, either the book must not be thick \emph{or} the
book must not be boring. This is summarized by 
\defn{De Morgan's Theorem}{
    \[\neg(P \wedge Q) \equiv \neg P \vee \neg Q\]
    \[\neg(P \vee Q) \equiv \neg P \wedge \neg Q\]
}

We now have a sufficient understanding of truth tables and 
logical connectives to come up with some useful rules. First of these 
are 
\defn{Modus ponens (mp)}{
    \begin{align*}
        &p \\
        &p \rightarrow q \\
        &\therefore q \\
    \end{align*}
}

and

\defn{Modus tollens (mt)}{
    \begin{align*}
        &p \rightarrow q \\
        &\neg q \\
        &\therefore \neg p \\
    \end{align*}
}

Below are two tables for commonly used rules.

\begin{table}[ht]
    \centering
    \caption{Equivalence rules}
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
    \hline
    Expression & Equivalent to & Name - abbreviation\\
    \hline
    $p \lor q$ & $q \lor p$ & Commutative - comm\\
    $p \land q$ & $q \land p $ &\\
    \hline
    $(p \lor q) \lor r$ &$p \lor (q \lor r)$ & Associative - ass\\
    $(p \land q) \land r$ &$p \land (q \land r)$ &\\
    \hline
    $\neg(p \wedge q)$ & $\neg p \vee \neg q$ & De Morgan's Laws - De Morgan\\
    $\neg(p \vee q)$ & $\neg p \wedge \neg q$ &\\
    \hline
    $p \rightarrow q$ & $\neg p \lor q$ & Implication - imp \\
    \hline
    $p$ & $\neg (\neg p)$ & Double negation - dn \\
    \hline
    $p \biconditional q$ & $(p \rightarrow q) \land (q \rightarrow )p$ & Def'n of equivalence - equ\\
    \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \label{tab:equivalencerules}
\end{table}

\begin{table}[ht]
    \centering
    \caption{Inference rules}
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
    \hline
    From & Can derive & Name - abbreviation\\
    \hline
    $p, p \rightarrow q$ & $q$ & Modus ponens - mp\\
    $p \rightarrow q, \neg q$ & $\neg p$ & Modus tollens - mt\\
    \hline
    $p, q$ & $p \lor q$ & Conjunction - con\\
    \hline
    $p \lor q, \neg p$ & $q$ & Disjunction - dis\\
    \hline
    $p \land q$ & $p, q$ & Simplification - sim\\
    \hline
    $p$ & $p \lor q$ & Addition - add\\
    \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \label{tab:inferencerules}
\end{table}

At this point, let us formally define an 

\defn{Argument}{An argument can be symbolized as 
\[P_1 \lor P_2 \lor P_3 \lor ... \lor P_n \rightarrow Q\] 
where $P_i$ is called a hypothesis and $Q$ is the conclusion.} If this statement
is a tautology, then the argument is \emph{valid}. 
There are multiple ways we could prove a given argument is a tautology.
For instance, we could create a truth table and brute force an answer.
However, with even four hypotheses this process is tedious, and with each additional hypothesis
it becomes exponentially harder. Therefore we instead often turn to the

\defn{Proof sequence}{a sequence of well-formed formulas 
in which each formula is either a hypothesis or the result 
of applying a derivation rule to earlier well-formed formulas.} In practice this looks like
\begin{align*}
    P_1 \quad &\text{(hypothesis)}\\
    P_2 \quad &\text{(hypothesis)}\\
    P_3 \quad &\text{(hypothesis)}\\
    &\dots \\
    P_n \quad &\text{(hypothesis)}\\
    \text{(formula) }1 \quad &\text{(obtained from derivation rule)} \\
    \text{(formula) }2 \quad &\text{(obtained from derivation rule)} \\
    &\dots \\
    \text{(formula) } n \quad &\text{(obtained from derivation rule)} \\
    \therefore Q \\
\end{align*}

Let's use all this new information in a simple proof. 
\begin{align*}
    A \quad &\text{(hypothesis)}\\
    A \rightarrow B \quad &\text{(hypothesis)}\\
    B \rightarrow C \quad &\text{(hypothesis)}\\
    B \quad &\text{(1, 2, mp)}\\
    C \quad &\text{(4, 3, mp)}\\
    \hline
    \therefore C \notag
\end{align*}
If we wish to apply our knowledge of logic to the real world, 
some practice in translating natural language to formal logic 
is necessary. Let's test it with this statement: "If chicken is on
the menu, then don't order fish, but you should have either fish or salad.
So if chicken is on the menu, have salad." 
Let $C$: "Chicken is on the menu", $F$: "You order fish", and $S$: "You have salad".
We know that if chicken is on the menu you don't order fish, that you should have
either fish or salad, and we'd like to show that if chicken is on the menu 
you should have salad.
\begin{align*}
    C \quad &\text{(hypothesis)}\\
    C \rightarrow \neg F \quad &\text{(hypothesis)}\\
    F \lor S \quad &\text{(hypothesis)}\\
    \neg F \quad &\text{(1, 2, mp)}\\
    S \quad &\text{(3, 4, dis)}\\
    \hline
    \therefore S \notag
\end{align*}
